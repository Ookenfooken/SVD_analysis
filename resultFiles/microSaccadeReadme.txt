Results are compiled from both pro and anti-saccade. Some subjects may have many missing values because they consistently blinked during fixation.
Since neither of the tasks was actually designed to assess micro-saccades, analysis was a bit tricky.
results are separated into "micro-saccades" (any saccade with an amplitude < 3 deg and "regular saccades" during fixation
